# BIKE HOSPITALITY
## Explore Italy on Two Wheels

**Bike Hospitality** is your gateway to experiencing Italy's scenic beauty on a bicycle! Launched by **Maitour** (Marche Italia Tour) in collaboration with the Italian Cycling Federation (F.C.I.), this 2022 initiative connects cyclists with a network of cyclist-friendly accommodations, businesses, and tourism operators throughout the Marche region.

### üåê What is Bike Hospitality?

Bike Hospitality is all about **sustainable travel and unforgettable adventures**. Through a collaborative network, has been created a system where local businesses and accommodations can apply for the "Bike Hospitality approved by F.C.I." status. Once certified, these spots become official destinations on designated cycling routes, making it easy for travelers to plan their rides with peace of mind.

### üí° How It Works

1. **Certified Hospitality**: Any business that meets specific cyclist-friendly criteria can earn the F.C.I. certification, allowing it to become part of the Bike Hospitality network and align with scenic routes, adding appeal for bike travelers.
   
2. **Tailored Cycling Routes**: Explore routes linked to certified stops, ensuring easy access to amenities and seamless experiences. Plan your ride from anywhere, with access points conveniently mapped to your current location.

3. **Events and Services**: Stay updated with upcoming events (competitive and recreational) and use the app to find services like accommodations, repair stations, and e-bike charging spots across Italy.
